ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUREdWN1enZ3RRAB,5,04/11/2024 17:45:12,"Had a pleasant stay here for 2 days and enjoyed breakfast lunch and dinner at their pure veg restaurant.  Special mention to the courteous and caring staff at the restaurant.

We found the room spacious and comfortable. It was fortunately devoid of the current trend of false ceiling and spot lights.

Ideally located close to temples, it has good food, comfy rooms,  hot water for bathing, kettles in the room,  good air conditioning, ample parking, lush green trees and good landscaping.. overall a beautiful experience.

Hope their service continues to be as good in the years to come."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURObDU3cEdBEAE,,01/02/2024 23:59:59,"The stay at hotel sadhabhishegam was very comfortable, the rooms were absolutely clean and the place was full of greenary. The hotel staffs are also good, take necessary action whenever we require anything. There is no complimentary breakfast but for that they give 200 discount coupon. There is a good pure veg eating place in the hotel. The food was excellent."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNkeGRhOFVREAE,,02/10/2024 23:59:59,"Hotel Sadhabishegam is very well maintained. The rooms are clean and hygenic.  This was one of my tequirements since i was travelling with a 2 year old daughter. Overall we had an excellent stay. Food was great and very nominal.
Cleanliness, food, proximity to the temple and excellent place to stay"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURUcUphdGxRRRAB,5,05/22/2024 00:23:53,"Stayed with our family in this hotel. Rooms are cleanly maintained. Vegetarian Food available, Quiet and great atmosphere and Kid friendly."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqdExHVWZBEAE,2,04/18/2024 08:02:13,"Earlier one of the quality hotels in Vaitheeswarankoil but now lacks maintenance and very old. Taps and racks are loose and sheets are torn at places.
Only redeeming factor is the restaurant's service and food taste. Decent service provided by staff."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURqcGEyck5BEAE,,04/02/2024 23:59:59,"We booked this hotel by seeing the Google reviews and you tube videos. But it was as similar as a normal hotel. Nothing much difference. Our room was filled with mosquitos. Bedsheet and bedspread had few dirts and also there was a frog in the room. We understand, since it is a resort with the greeny environment it is common, but it is a basic thing that a room should be cleaned before the guest arrived as it is pre-booked. Our experience was average, nothing different or added advantage 😞"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQxMmJ6ZHNBRRAB,5,01/08/2024 13:01:33,"Visited this hotel and had lunch with family. A good restaurant in a small town. Restaurant if full of air conditioned and good service.
Food is good. They have options even for lunch. Many hotels in small towns will not have options, as we have to take only meals.

Restaurant compound is too big, it has rooms too (not tried).

Outside of restaurant good parking space available and also drivers or even we can sleep under tree."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNWeXNUZUdnEAE,4,12/06/2023 15:32:50,"Ideal stay place for a night or two while visiting Navagraha Temples nearby.
Affordable stay . You get a complimentary Breakfast coupon worth Rs 100 per person
Which you can redeem in the restaurant.
Rooms are decent. Service is good. The rooms are not sound proof so expect external noise . The restaurant and the menu is good with tasty and hot food served. They have some time restrictions for each session. Morning coffee is available mostly after 7 am. The hot water geyser was not working well. There is a lack of coordination between reception and other staff. The location is very nearby to the temple walkable for 5 min. Autos are available outside. Car parking is plenty. A decent stay place for all"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMxckxEOTVnRRAB,4,12/24/2023 12:55:59,"Great place to stay near the temple. The rooms were good and comfortable. But for the price charged they could keep the rooms cleaner. The floor, table and chairs were all dusty throughout my stay there. Requested them once to clean it as well."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNENHJPVzdRRRAB,4,03/26/2024 08:23:04,"Good place to stay. Temple is about a km away. If no car, then hire an auto to temple. For tonsuring one is forced to go to office inside the temple to get token. Tonsuring hut is 500 meters far. Temple could have token ( Rs 10) issuing counter at Tonsuring hut itself instead of punishing devotees to run among the crowd."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURqcFlxLVlBEAE,,03/08/2024 23:59:59,"Good ambience..good food..great service..authentic food..wonderful time..neat rooms..good beds. They have nice garden .calves, geese the kids enjoyed .the filter kaapi was really good ..spacious rooms, hot water at all times. Courteous behaviour, good food"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNEN1lpRlhBEAE,1,03/31/2024 10:40:28,"Horrible service by the receptionist . No sense of customer value . He picked up the phone to answer to or enquiry about the room and spoke very rudely. His response was so bad that he made us wait on call and didn't answer to us , he was talking to another customer apparently. Talking to another customer is fine , but why attend the call simultaneously!! If the receptionist has attended to our call then he should have politely asked us to wait . Instead he spoke in an inappropriate manner and hang up on our face.  It clearly depicted the arrogancy he had. There are many hotels to stay if not for this one , but even before a customer could come if this is the kind of attitude they are going to show them imagine after a customer stays at their place what not they can do ."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM5Z19YWmdnRRAB,5,03/09/2024 00:05:07,The hotel is situated in the prime location of vaitheeswaran temple. It is walkable from the temple and once can travel to other pilgrimage spots from here. The rooms are neat cozy. It is not bombarded with lots of things. It is simple. The view is very eye-catching. There is garden with a lot of flowers and birds. I saw a lot of cute ducks walking around. They have a ln attached restaurant where all varieties of food is available.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURqMTg2WVlREAE,1,05/09/2024 08:50:45,"During 06/05/2024, the lunch served in the AC restaurant at Vaitheeswaran Koil was not good. The next day many people complained about dysentery, vomiting followed by fever. So some items may be contaminated, maybe the vadai, which was sour in taste they had served. Also the lunch service was very poor. There was no order in serving items. Serving people were not trained in hotel management."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMxM09MRzd3RRAB,4,12/25/2023 06:41:08,"Rooms are clean and good. Food quality is normal but too expensive, outdoor facilities need to improve. Parking and Driver facilities need to improve. Overall experience Nice place to stay with Family and friends."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURONU1uTFpREAE,,11/05/2023 23:59:59,"The rooms were just basic with NO facilities for driver rest area considering it’s a tourist destination they must have a good one for drivers. Also another issue was that there is no hot water in the late evenings / nights when you are back from traveling all day that’s the bare basic necessity that one expects. Food was good , no complaints there."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM5eFlQdFh3EAE,2,03/07/2024 14:35:49,"No hot water, no kettle and other services. If we order coffee at 5.30am they provide at 6.30am. if any marriage group came, individual stay people are not treated properly. Only advantage is, temple is 400m from location and hotel is just opposite to bus stand. Otherwise not worth for money.."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQxcmYyNFN3EAE,2,01/09/2024 09:13:50,We had lunch yesterday with the family during the pilgrimage. Practically all food items esp. meals are loaded with a highly generous amount of salt.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUREMzlEMGJnEAE,5,04/16/2024 05:52:52,Had a very pleasant stay. The quality of food was too good. The staff were excellent and very courteous.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURUcE5TbGxBRRAB,2,05/22/2024 16:36:08,Worst service in canteen (upilli restaurant)..women staffs are good ..mens are worst .. In kids play area (in the park ) most of the things are broken ..not maintained well..
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURkMXNTSXZRRRAB,4,02/23/2024 12:07:22,"Went here for lunch. Lunch was very good. Purely vegetarian. People who served were are very good at their job. Even though it was very crowded, they served without delay."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNEajhmdFFREAE,5,04/03/2024 09:55:44,"Good ambience, very courteous staff,homely food, rooms were neat and clean, near to vaitheeswaran temple.We enjoyed our stay"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUROekszV2tBRRAB,,09/24/2023 23:59:59,Excellent facilities. Cordial staff. Very good atmosphere. Hygienic vegetarian food. Spacious rooms in a  natural setting. We 15 peoples enjoyed our stay with campfire in the night. Lot of temples nearby Hotel sadabishkam. |There is Kayaking facility nearby we spent our time fun with divinity.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURaaE9TbHJRRRAB,5,09/24/2023 11:02:11,"I recently stayed at Hotel Sadhabishegam with my business friends for 2 days and it was a fantastic experience. The staff were incredibly friendly and accommodating, making us feel right at home. The rooms were clean, comfortable, and had a serene atmosphere that added to the spiritual nature of our visit.

The location is perfect, right in the heart of the Vaitheeswarankoil place, making it convenient to access all the religious sites. The food at the hotel's restaurant was delicious, offering a taste of the local cuisine.

I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting this destination. It's a place where comfort, spirituality, and excellent service come together to create a memorable experience."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNEOVBPbHNBRRAB,5,03/25/2024 04:18:53,Food was good rooms I haven't tried. Little expensive. Good quality lodges available
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUROakl5MEJnEAE,,12/16/2023 23:59:59,Wonderful experience with great service and the best staff . The food was very great and good with proper hygeine . One of the best hotel for stay in this area . And  the hotal is soo beautiful it gives the proper village vibe .
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNsaVpuQVFREAE,4,11/21/2023 09:15:29,Rooms were very good.. spacious and comfortable... Only one negative remark is the extra bed ..  which was really like a boat... Had to remove mattress from the cot and placed it on floor and slept... Otherwise rooms were too good..
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ1NGJ2UjFBRRAB,5,10/25/2023 16:34:21,Had been to this hotel during evening coffee time after the temple visit. The staff had cultural activities n the place was deserted. The lady in snack bar said they r having employee engagement activities. Since my 6 yr old was hungry I requested for food. She managed to get a boy to serve parotta and we were ok with that. Location n staff behaviour was good.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURWd0lMUHh3RRAB,4,12/10/2023 07:35:17,"I recently stayed at Hotel Sadhabishegam with my family for 3 days and it was a very good experience.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURaaEl6WUpBEAE,5,09/24/2023 11:09:21,"Excellent hotel in this area with plenty of green space with spacious rooms, hygienic vegetarian food served in both AC and Non Ac dining halls, plenty of parking space.
Staff are well mannered and very friendly.
Ac rooms are real value for money.
Our 15 member group enjoyed camp fire, nearby kayaking during our visit.
The bus stand, and the temple are within walking distance from this hotel. Their vathakozhumbu was my favourite.
The space around the rooms were very pleasing"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURaN2RHaXNBRRAB,5,10/08/2023 00:29:36,The place is nice and the staff was very helpful. The room and the bathroom  was clean. But the AC does not work well. In a place like Vaideeswaram where the weather requires AC I think it is important to take that as an important criterion. The food at the restaurant is excellent. Loved their crisp dosas especially after a day long trip to different places. The staff brings in the order very fast.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURsM1pmYjB3RRAB,5,12/03/2023 09:57:02,The hotel was very excellent and the rooms are neat and clean.The food was awesome and they served south indian food for home made taste.The entire staffs are so friendly
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMxbmZTVUZREAE,4,01/02/2024 15:29:56,"The hotel is average because it is poorly maintained. AC and TV remote, Intercom not working.  The staff were fine and the food was decent as well."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNGdTRuamJREAE,1,11/03/2023 04:54:19,"Very worst restaurant. There are no people to serve foods. We literally served ourselves like self-service. Very bad experience. The taste is also not good. only a money-looting mindset. Very bad service.We felt wasted our money and peace.
Restaurant visited date: 03/11/2023
Time : 9.30AM"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNUM3BDOU53EAE,5,05/15/2024 06:10:46,It is one of the best hotel near by Vaitheeswaran temple devotees
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUREM19IM0pnEAE,4,04/16/2024 06:54:53,"Very costly morning tiffen.dosai items ₹85 and above.neat parking,hygiene rest rooms.environment friendly."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ1c0ppdndBRRAB,5,10/19/2023 03:02:48,Very nice ambience. Will have the feel of a resort. Staff also very helpful. All behaves very great. For Vaitheeswaran Koil this is a 7 star property. They have to change the furniture and to concentrate on Linen part. Food is good and tasty too
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURaaW9Lek5BEAE,1,09/28/2023 09:38:24,"We stayed for 3 days & we never got hot water for bath... The staff used to get the water from different room. When i questioned the manager for not fixing the geyser, he asked us to shift to another room & on top of it he was damn rude.

Cleanliness was below average. Every morning i had to remind them to clean the room & they never gave us water bottle unless asked.

Lady staff employees were really good... Kudos to them"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURaNVp6VlhBEAE,4,10/05/2023 08:44:19,"Overall it is very good place for Veg. Options

Breakfast menu options were less in the morning around 9.30 am, during our recent visit (only dosa poori were available).

Anyone travelling from faraway places would certainly expect basic menu options to be available. I hope the hotel management will look into this."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNGMzlEUUNREAE,,02/03/2023 23:59:59,"already vacated
spacious room. quite atmosphere. scenic ambience. bathrooms are very clean n excellent. ample hotwater during peak hours. only improvement is their single seater sofa inside room that needs a makeover as the leather fabric has kind of worning out. overall an excellent place to stay in that location if you are travelling with family."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMxc0x2R3hRRRAB,5,12/21/2023 16:49:56,"Had a pleasant stay and room service was soo good.
Restaurant and food was very awesome and in good quantity."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUROMUx6Skl3EAE,,09/24/2023 23:59:59,"Clean and neat rooms, Healthy food and a great ambiance for the family and kids to enjoy. Has a lawn and green areas, also has a mini hall for events. Senior citizen friendly and awesome hospitality from the staffs."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUROcElqdjRnRRAB,,03/19/2023 23:59:59,"Large and spacious room. Air conditioning worked wonderfully. Inside room had a king bed and the ante room a single bed. The WC, shower and wash basin were separate making it very functional. Bedding, pillows and towels were adequate. A 10 minute walk from the temple. MS. Selvi and her team in the restaurant took good care of us during lunch and dinner. Hard working and ever smiling ladies. Food was tasty and reasonably priced. Room 304 where we stayed was next to the dish washing and laundry area of the hotel. After a six hour drive, we were subjected to loud clanging of vessels and washing after their lunch service. The hotel could have easily put us up in a quieter room. The room service for tea never came after an hour's wait. The staff at the front desk didnt seem to care much. It would be a great place to stay if they could take care of these few things."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR0bU5lZFhREAE,4,02/02/2024 10:10:02,Had lunch and it was really good. Especially the people who are served so kind.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNOaHMySnJ3RRAB,5,01/14/2024 01:52:01,Amazing stay I had with my family. A must stay place for families going for a happy trip
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNUNmNLRHF3RRAB,4,05/16/2024 13:26:42,Good feel to sleep. Clean and good food
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURobE4ybFpnEAE,5,03/02/2023 08:24:40,"Very nice meals, bit crowded and u need to have some patience & time to wait. Good food, good service. Didn't get time to visit the play area outside but there is. Nice car parking available in front of a small Ganesha looking over. There's a juice Hut too but not tried."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUROaFBDLVlnEAE,,05/31/2023 23:59:59,"A Clean, Best Maintained Property. Value for Money and Spacious Rooms. Good Service. Keep It Up Team||Had been with my family, great support right from parking to check-out||Vaitheeswaran Hospitality. Enjoyed..."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNKaHRXSXZBRRAB,2,06/26/2023 01:35:03,"The location & ambiance are good. Food was ok, no complaints as such. But the service to give you a table,the serving of food etc till giving you the bill were very poor. Sunday was going to be crowded by people visiting V.koil but they were not capable of handling it in any aspect. If you're patient enough for things to come from the service it will take some time to finish & walk out."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMxczVmX09REAE,5,01/03/2024 12:41:52,The food they served was like a home food and service were really awesome
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCMjdHalRnEAE,5,01/05/2023 08:58:04,Had lunch at this place. South Indian meals only for ₹140. Extremely tasty food. Very friendly and hygienic service. The place has strict rules to avoid food wastage. It is well appointed in the vicinity of vaideeswaran temple. The pickle that was served on request was on the salty side. That was a very minor glitch. Overall 5/5 for banana leaf meals.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCMXMyN1lREAE,4,01/18/2023 21:41:53,"This is a pilgrims' paradise(as per the hotel's advt) for those visiting Vaitheeswaran temple nearby. Both sheltered and open parking spaces available with restroom facility. Good vegetarian restaurant in the vicinity/surroundings and hotel rooms also available though didn't stay. Service can be improved. Overall, a good place for stopover."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoZ05TSmZ3EAE,3,02/26/2023 13:10:48,"It’s an okay hotel. Nothing great about it. It’s close to the temple. Room tv is 1 inch bigger than a laptop. AC is making continuous noise. Price is definitely on the higher end. Lunch was okay, yet to have dinner. Overall decent but pricing is higher."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMDRfUGJREAE,5,05/03/2023 07:28:46,"Stayed in AC cottage with 3 beds in ground floor.  Value for money. Good room service.  Tasty vegetarian food in restaurant. Rs 200 discount in breakfast bill.
Room wifi and complimentary breakfast they can give.
Overall excellent experience"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURaOGVQZFRnEAE,5,10/03/2023 11:45:46,"We visited for lunch. We tried buffet meals menu . Everything is hot and served in a good manner. Ambience is very good.

Thumbs for the food taste."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNEMEsyTk5REAE,5,03/23/2024 13:52:44,Nice staying rooms and restaruant very good.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCeTRiZGFBEAE,4,01/04/2023 13:15:31,"Stayed with family for a couple of nights. Rooms were spacious, neat and clean. Food was excellent. They may have to improve the service at the restaurant which was very poor. Otherwise, the location is very near to the temple, has ample car parks and had a pleasant stay"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUROalBUc1NREAE,,05/28/2023 23:59:59,"Very bad experience with staying - there is no water and the staffs were really harsh in addressing the problem. We are a regular customer of Sadabishekam. We always stay in your resort whenever we pass through this route. We wanted to bring this issue to the owner’s notice to avoid lossing good customers in the future. Also, this morning we didn’t have a good experience with your hotel. The food was not cooked properly and staff are terrible. There is no incharge or manager available to complaint. Manager comes at 10:30am only so customers can’t complaint. If this is going to continue, I don’t think Sadhabishekam would stay in the market."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURaaEtMbG5nRRAB,5,09/24/2023 11:25:54,"Hotel Sadhabhishegam in Vaitheeswaran Koil offers a delightful stay. Impeccable service, cozy rooms, and proximity to the temple make it a top choice. The authentic South Indian cuisine is a highlight. A tranquil retreat for spiritual travelers. Highly recommended!"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURaaWY2VXB3RRAB,1,10/03/2023 13:44:09,Been there for breakfast. By the time we reached there it's around 9.30 am most of the breakfast items are over. Beautiful thing here is there none to inform you about limited breakfast item availability.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUROcE5XVUVREAE,,05/28/2023 23:59:59,"OMG very bad expérience. Rooms do not have water.  Food is not hygienic.  We regularly visit sadhabhishekam. But in recent days it lost its credibility. There is one lady manager named Sathya. She is really a head strong person, Never even responds to customers and treat like beggars. Stop going to this place anymore"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURWLV82eW13RRAB,5,12/17/2023 04:25:24,"We enjoyed our stay here.
Staff are kind and helpful."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNEOXU2dXJ3RRAB,4,03/28/2024 05:44:28,For the locations they are in the servers best quality food.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURaZ2RhUk9REAE,4,10/02/2023 08:27:23,"Hotel Sadhabhishegam is situated in the VaitheeswaranKoil to Mayiladuthurai Road.

I have been visiting Hotel Sadhabishegam for the all special occasions.The hotel is mostly preferred for it's cheap and clean rooms.The food was also good when I visited the last time.Its also very close to Vaitheeswaran Temple,walkable distance."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNkenM3eVBnEAE,1,02/15/2024 07:33:12,Restaurant service very worst. Staff are very rude. Had a bad experience.

The food was very tasty
Especially the Vathakolambu.
It's good place to stay with family"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNGOTRpLVNREAE,,01/01/2022 23:59:59,"Its always a pleasure staying at this hotel mainly because of the resort kinda feel it gives. The ambience is peaceful and serene with lot of space to walk around if you are someone inclined to spend time with nature. Rooms are neat & clean, This was my 3rd time & my stay was as delightful as the previous ones. The only negative if I have to say is the meals which can be better at the restaurant. Also the room service was not very prompt as before, may be lack of staff due to current situation. But otherwise, worth the money."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNwOXVYUm53RRAB,4,08/03/2023 15:27:31,This hotel is located very conveniently for devotees visiting the temple circuit between chidambaram & mayavaram. The restaurant is very clean and offers quality South Indian cuisines at affordable prices.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoeWZlUmZREAE,4,03/12/2023 02:40:23,"Hotel rooms are good, neat & clean. Rooms spread across a garden. Mosquitos big menace, courtesy more wet garden area.  Restaurant is lousy during early morning hours. Car parking not adequate."

I ate meals.. Really nice and worth for money...

For some people meal is not available but they arranged variety rice food immediately without saying nothing available... That's is really good...

Improvement required :
seating arrangements needs to be improved.

Otherwise restaurants overall rating is Good.."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCMjVQR3pBRRAB,5,01/05/2023 10:02:27,"Veg meals are always ready and tastes good too.
Outside the hotel they have a small sit out where they serve juice and ice cream.
Toilets are well maintained and hygienic.

Very close to vaithyanatgeshwaran temple."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4cFB1WWFBEAE,4,05/11/2023 00:26:21,"There is a nice restaurant on the ground floor. The food there is quite good. No menu, waiter will verbally tell you items available. During lunch hour it's mostly vegetarian meal. In breakfast and dinner you have options of idlis, dosas and puri items. Food is tasty and reasonably priced."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1bHVfNFNREAE,2,07/27/2022 16:59:57,"Undoubtedly the rooms are good. And they have a good kitchen but completely unsatisfactory service, its worst. They told its 24hrs hot water, but no hot water at night and morning till 7. Had to call the reception folks 5-6 times but no response. And no one were present at the reception to ask. Tv is in every room but not in a functioning state, when asked they told signal problem all the rooms are facing it.. Like seriously.. and the room charges are pretty high compared to others. Two star just for the rooms and restaurant."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSaEsyUFZnEAE,3,03/25/2023 08:46:23,"Not informing what I had ordered properly.... I had ordered a chapati but when they served it was only chapati without any side dish, when i asked they replied that the usual kurma was over. If it was over it should have been informed to me in prior so that I can order a seperate side dish.The food quality was pretty good"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNwaFlpMU5nEAE,1,08/07/2023 02:09:59,"0 star for service. I am trying to get some decent (complimentary) breakfast here for the last half an hour :-(
They are absolutely testing the limits of my patience.
Go to Akshardham instead; that is a better place"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtOEp2WGR3EAE,5,12/16/2021 12:00:07,Fantastic hotel to stay. Has modern fittings in bathrooms and very strong furniture. All air-conditioners are new and cool the room quickly. No cheap stuff here. Food and coffee are great too. Restaurant staff went over and above their duty in providing amenities and service. Very proximate to the V Temple and one of the best places to rest and recuperate.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdEpYcTlBRRAB,4,03/26/2023 12:12:24,"Rooms are old and need maintenance desperately. Rest, the service of staff and food was nice. A beautiful place, I wish rooms are maintained properly since they charge premium price."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUROOU9TSkJREAE,,02/19/2023 23:59:59,"Not worth the money. They charge around 2700 rs per night, but when i checked in, found the following:||1. Bed sheets and rug were very poor quality|2. Bed sheets had holes|3. Telephone in room did not work. Cable was disconnected|4. No hot water although the pipe has a mixer option. Called the reception, but no response|6. A/c restaurant was not working. They said only non a/c.  The restaurant was very average|7. Be prepared for mosquitoes.||This hotel is not worth the money. They should not charge more than 1500 rs.  They are ripping off customers because they and Akshardham are the only two options here.||Akshardam is much better. I could not get a room, hence had to choose Sadhabishekam."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCN2FYaU5REAE,3,01/26/2023 08:38:54,"We had breakfast here. Taste vice OK. But the price was too high compared to the dishes served. In crowd time the service also very poor. We had to wait for a long time to have additional sampar for dosai served. Not served water in time.
They billed like a 5 star hotel.
Some Items and prices we ordered..
Rost dosai ₹90
Milk ₹35
Horlicks ₹46"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1bi1HZ2t3RRAB,5,09/02/2022 13:03:36,"One of the best hotels we have stayed in. The rooms are like cottages, unlike traditional hotels where there is a corridor and rooms on either side. Here, there are 2 floors, with one room above the other. Steps lead from the ground floor to the floor, all in the open, no corridors. Room was spacious, bathrooms and the outside surroundings were clean. Most of the service personnel were women.
Would be good if they had a kettle in the rooms.
The veg restaurant was very good. Had lunch breakfast and dinner. Against managed and serviced by women. Excellent service, with a smile.
Good place to stay for visiting duvyadesams near sirkazhi.
Parking facility available. Bus stop and stand nearby."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoNFltNnJ3RRAB,4,02/15/2023 03:18:21,Clean and spacious rooms. Book personally as online booking is only for 12 hrs as per hotel staff. Walkable distance to Vaideeshwaran kovil. Opp. Bus stop. The restaurant serves good food but the service takes time. Friendly and helpful staff. Use a translator online for better communication.

It has parking facility, rest room facility
Coffee, tea"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURaLVAyUFdREAE,5,09/24/2023 09:49:17,"By Far the very Best stay and hotel for Temple towns and visit at Vaitheeswaran Koil .
It's has a authentic and classic homely touch for the stay and delicious food .
I would definitely recommend to experience the stay.👌🏻"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdzhtUy13RRAB,5,05/02/2023 13:32:58,"The best hotel for both stay and dining at Vaitheeswaran Koil. Very good, hot and tasty lunch in the hotel. Has more than decent car parking space and place for drivers to rest and sleep. Very big and spacious rooms and a good convention center.
Highly recommended for stay and food in vaitheeswaran koil. Very near to the head tonsure place and has guest rest room facility including for bath."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyZ2ItM3N3RRAB,2,04/22/2022 16:45:21,"I went to the restaurant on 21st April,  2022. I had lunch. The cost of the Lunch is Rs. 190. First they served Vegetable Biriyani, which was very spicy. Then, a proper veg meals was served in its order. Our expectations went down. Many items were good for diabetic patients as there was little salt and less taste. The staff were polite. The location was extra ordinary. There was  enough parking facility. The taste has to be improved"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPek4yaUFnEAE,5,07/01/2022 15:59:20,"The place is very calm and relaxing. The cutlets served were yummy. Coffee and tea were also very good. Just once the coffee was not up to their regular standard, it was a little lighter and did not taste that good."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSdWZuZkJBEAE,4,04/29/2023 07:16:19,"I will give a 4 rating. I booked this hotel in Agoda after seeing reviews. In short sumarizingmy experience as follows

Pros
It’s like a small resort
Lot of open spaces, greeneries, kids play area, Vaitheeswaran temple at 850m, autos and bus easily accessible, courteous staff behaviour, limited variety but awesome meals in the afternoon, limited but good breakfast, limited but good options for dinner, good coffee. Mosquito mat, cosmetic kit

Cons
It seems they have renovated the resort for eg bathroom tiles and fitting are new but mirrors, sofas are worn out and faded. You should close doors in the evening tightly or else mosquitoes or small bugs may come in. Water bottle in room could be better like bisleri or aquafina because the bottle we got almost looks like 20% crushed due to mishandling. Price slightly looks on the higher side but I think it can be a bit lesser by a few hundred bucks.

Other than that it would really make ur pilgrimage stay comfortable."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURWLThIcFdREAE,5,12/17/2023 04:30:29,Great place and supporting staff and awesome jain food 😃
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMHJLYnRBRRAB,5,03/29/2023 05:54:53,Best hotel and restaurant in this part of the world. Rooms are clean and well maintained. The restaurant has really good food. And the staff here are super helpful and always smiling. Will highly recommend the place and would suggest others visiting vaitheeswaran koil to stay here
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNGOTktamVBEAE,,12/05/2022 23:59:59,"Had been staying in this property since long, they are maintaining the hotel top notch, the garden is lovely and so is the restaurant. Good food. Easy on stomach and price moderate. Very nice stay. Keep it up."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNGcl9fTWVBEAE,,04/06/2022 23:59:59,"Read fully to understand the reason for 1 star.Response for any additional pillow/etc.: 0/5 ( your door might be banged at 4:30 AM intentionally. Reason below).Room - 4/5 ( reduced 1 for A/C, its not much efficient and swing wasn't working. It might take time to cool the room, so manageable. Please check the A/C before moving the luggage. Rest all good - Bed, restrooms and lights).Restaurant/service - 5/5 ( I really liked the food, even after 9pm they served idly for kids. Most of the items were decent and definitely no complaints).Room service - 3.5/5 ( It may not be prompt but we can adjust since there might be little overcrowd in the Restaurant. Need to mention that quantity of coffee/tea in the flask is way more than you get in any other hotels under room service).Check-in & check-out : 4/5. ( you may need to carry your luggage while check-out since response time might take time. Reason below)."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1eUtHMWVBEAE,3,08/12/2022 06:11:43,"Three stars for spacious room, clean bathroom, good outside atmosphere ambiance, restaurant facility and playing area.

Reducing stars for the guest hospitality and drinking water facility. They give only 3 bottles as complementary and didn’t informed us about anything extra will be charged and no normal drinking water also provided by the hotel, when asking for water in the night no one picked up phone and later charged extra for the water bottle.
Also there was issue with the lights in one of the rooms and it wasn’t fixed even after we raised it at the reception.

This hotel needs definite improvement as this accommodation one of the costliest stay in Vaitheeswaran Koil area. So adding this review so people can read and aware about it."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNwMmVTWkR3EAE,4,08/06/2023 16:06:06,"Sappadu is good. Dont eat at mayavaram if u go by car. Eat here. The serving ladies are curtesious and forthcoming.  U know , they made pudhina துவையல்  and served it immediately.  Paruppu podi, sambar, rasam. They make 2 koottu. Awesome.   Worth 5 stars actually.  Night tiffion time is a total mayhem. Go earler, u will get rubber idlies. I mean rubber like... my votes ate for lunch and lunch only."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMxamF5alNnEAE,5,01/02/2024 07:20:35,Nice rooms. Decent vegetarian  food
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtcC1Qc0hBEAE,5,11/15/2022 02:54:08,Good vegetarian restaurant and clean rooms. Walkable distance from temple. Good parking place. Food is good. However online booking of rooms from their own website  is a bit problematic. Inspite of having confirmation mail of my booking the person at the reception said there was no booking in my name although it was a prepaid booking and said his system does not show any booking in my name. He relented only after talking to his senior who talked to me also very politely.  Only after that I was given a room. The management should sort this out as this is an excellent hotel in every respect and  being told there is no booking after having paid for it in advance can be a bit annoying. Highly recommended 👌
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNldHJYX2h3RRAB,4,09/13/2022 15:53:04,It's lost its previous charm. Looks run down a lot. But rooms are spacious and beds are good  and clean. I feel the prices are on the upside. The restaurant is very very slow in service. Ample parking.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPM2NYTjR3RRAB,1,07/13/2022 03:32:53,"Went here to have lunch at around 2.30 pm. twice. While entering itself the security showed that meals is not there as if chasing us out. Only parotta was available on the first day. Poor service. For coffee we had to go outside. Not recommended. You will be disappointed as a tourist and expect to have lunch here. Very bad experience.
I request the owner to make Meals available at least till 3.30 pm. as tourists coming from different places expecting to have lunch here may get delayed in their journey."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURGei1yS1N3EAE,4,11/11/2023 17:07:27,The hotel is neat and tidy. The hotel area is spacious and is in a natural setting.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNGM191WXVnRRAB,,07/05/2022 23:59:59,"It was a pleasant stay there. Perfect for stay with family. Rooms were spacious and clean. Staffs and service persons were friendly and responded to every need of ours promptly. Only concern is restroom latch was not working fine, so unable to lock the door. Also we don't have free breakfast option available"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ5bmJLN2FnEAE,1,03/20/2024 03:27:49,"Restaurant service is worst
Taking long time to serve foods"

Good for a quick stay to follow up with Vaitheeshwaran temple visit. We went as 2 families, newly wed couple & the stay was pleasant. There is a nice backyard with Goose & we relaxed by the swing & benches. Overall a good stay."

About Accomodation - this is quite disappointing , no proper maintenance of the rooms. This property is resort type, very old and needs renovation, house keeping is not proper , the room we got was in the ground floor -found centipede and lizards inside room. Comfort AC bed for 3 people accommodation is charged close to 4000INR including complimentary breakfast.
Room facilities - bath towels and soap only.
No drinking water, no glasses,no tissue papers were provided.
For the rate mentioned found its not worth for the facilities provided, located in a smaller town."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlemFDODFBRRAB,4,09/20/2022 15:16:01,"Located on the way to vaitheeswaran koil. This restaurant provided the best menu and the service of food.  Order is taking using  a tablet. Staff are  very courteous and the podi idly with coconut and tomato chutney was delicious . And very easy to locate and it also consists of rooms and a function hall fully air conditioned and there is ample parking space with enough shade from the heat in the place..

Overall this is one of the best place for  breakfast , lunch or dinner."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlck5tTHRBRRAB,5,10/04/2022 09:53:08,"I didn't stay here. Visited only the Restaurent. Hence this Review is only about the Restaurent.

We were on a tour. After visiting Vaithiswarankoil Temple, We visited this Restaurent for Lunch.

It is worth visiting. Nice Ambience. Comfortable Seats. Courteous Staff. We ordered Unlimited Meals. Food was Excellent. They provide Dhal Powder with Good Ghee and full fare of South Indian Meals.

Rooms appears to be Good and Inspiring. There is a Well maintained Park to relax and Children's Park etc.

After seeing this, I decided to try this place for staying during my next trip"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtdWVXZUpnEAE,2,01/03/2022 08:56:27,"Food was good though bit costly . Simple afternoon lunch with two side dishes cost Rs 140.  Waiters do not care to serve  drinking water. After lot of follow up, drinking water was served when we were about to finish waiting. Car parking is spacious. We chose the place for car parking only."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHb2RUbUJ3EAE,1,10/31/2021 16:30:46,"This review is regarding food. The food is extremely costly while the quality and ambience is as good as any normal simple veg restaurant. The cost is even more than a five star restaurant. For example, a cup of milk costs 36 rs. Even half litre of milk outside is around 20 rs. Imagine about other items. Please be careful, folks from distant places. Reviewing immediately after having dinner just now...I think they are charging so much because of monopoly.."

You feel so good to step out of the room and take a walk around and enjoy the nature. The rooms are clean, washrooms are very well maintained. There are some improvement required 1. Beds cushion can be slightly better and I feel they are old. 2. AC remotes are worn out and does not operate properly. Unable to increase or decrease the cooling u can only switch off the air-condition."

I think her name is Ramya. she co ordinated very well and friendly approach make us very comfortable. we onboard the hotel with 2 kid's. the receptionist and the restaurant supervisor Pramila and entire (team) helped very well and supported in kids requirements. Food they have provided in the restaurant is too good in taste and quality. especially the way servering by Pramila and team is very appreciative.  outside atmosphere of hotel is main attraction. my 2.5 old kid likes very much the garden area with ducks, rabbit, playing area etc. even myself like too. overall we had very good and comfortable stay. my sincere thanks to each and (every staff) in the hotel. every staff friendly nature makes very nice atmosphere to stay. I will prefer others to go for it. in future my priority will be Sadhabishegam only."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPMTdLdVpREAE,5,06/22/2022 06:47:24,We ate at the restaurant here. It is located just 5 minutes from Vaitheeswaran temple. The parking was easy and the south Indian meals were good. Great place to stop for lunch after visiting the temple.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNGbjZ1SzVBRRAB,,06/02/2019 23:59:59,The ambiance of the hotel was unique and refreshing. The staff of the hotel were courteous in the utmost way. The food had a tinge of local flavors which made it appetizing. The rooms are well maintained though there exists a bit scope of improvement. The park and greenery serve as a major boost for the tourists. The best stay for kids and families.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyckkzRzV3RRAB,4,05/08/2022 14:22:31,"We did not stay here but had lunch. They have good size of car parking area,  AC and non AC veg restaurant. We had lunch in AC restaurant. Food tasted good. Service was very nice. Staffs were very courteous. I like this place ☺️"

Restaurant was decent with good taste but limited menu. open parking available. restaurant staff was very accommodating. cons were no fleece blanket and only normal thin blankets only suitable for summer and not for winter. only soap provided can add shampoo at least. bit pricier. No cupboards or locker. Overall good for family and would return back and also recommend."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPcnJiNGR3EAE,4,07/05/2022 18:10:12,"This locality there's no great choice, in that sense this was a good stay. The food was good, could've been a bit spicy but i guess it's catered for elderly.
Rooms are good, clean restrooms and a decent play area."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5bU9hY2ZnEAE,4,01/18/2021 15:22:57,"The property has excellent ambience. Very helpful staff. Good food. The only negative point was that I was excess charged. They had added a ""weekend charge"" of Rs.1200/- to the bill. After I pointed out that when I made the online booking more than a month back the period for which I booked was already a weekend only and did not become a weekend now, they agreed to reduce the ""weekend charge""."

Food wise pretty average, especially Sambar Sadham, but still it costs around 75, so it’s not worth it! They have got Panneer Soda too, but it’s served in less quantity compared to the bottled ones.

Staff are friendly and ready to help."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCdlAyQ0JREAE,5,01/14/2023 11:10:47,"One of the best places to have super tasty south Indian leaf meals. The food was served piping hot even at 3.30 pm and so were the items. Mixed vegetable sambar, 2 poriyal, karakozhambu, rasam and curd.. Everything tasted so good here.

Visiting Vaideeswaran Koil? Sadabhisekham is the only place to have guaranteed super good food...

Keep it up.."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXbzVPSUh3EAE,1,04/02/2022 17:57:45,"Unprofessional behaviour by the manager, very rude and simply blames the hotel management !! . not worth the price ..  We 5 adults along with 2 children (2 double room) stayed at this property on 1st to 2nd April. Receptionist staffs , room service and restaurant staffs were all good and served us well.
The bad experience was
1. They have weird policy of issuing coupons (100off) per room . That has to be presented during breakfast , but we missed to do that and wasn’t told that it can’t be reimbursed during checkout .. I forgot to present that coupon during breakfast and when I asked some staff they told it can be presented during checkout ..

During checkout they denied to deduct it and the staff named Rajan or someone told in a very harsh tone that it’s customer’s mistake of not reading the terms and conditions printed on the backside of a small piece paper called as breakfast coupon . I have been to multiple resorts and hotels even a small lodges will have some level of courtesy towards the customer but this in particular simply blames on the management saying they have to obey the management !! This is my first stay in sadhabhishegam but this person in particular made it worst !!

another worst part is their lunch availability is minimal so be prepared to plan ur lunch or you will have to wait for long hours

They don’t have coffee or tea available in the early morning , it will be available only after 6 am

Rooms are not maintained well it’s looks old and stinking ., but washrooms are clean !!

Nice property but poor maintenance !! It will be worth the money (as it is 2300 per room) if they manage and maintain well"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNGNTZHVmR3EAE,,08/27/2021 23:59:59,"Booked their comfort non-AC room. It had big bed room and additional room. The additional room had a single bed which works well for family of 4. I really liked separate bath and toilet which can used simultaneously and feels pleasant while bathing (instead of ugly looks at commode in integrated bathrooms). Rooms/bathrooms were neat and in good condition. Probably they should add net to windows for non-AC users.

The restaurant in the campus offers good food at reasonable prices. And this campus looks like resort with trees/plants/parks etc. Overall it was very pleasant stay."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ1X3VpZXBRRRAB,1,10/25/2023 02:46:37,"Food was really very limited, staff found it very difficult to catter the crowd, really worst . Never excepted this from this hotel"
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNJc2JTWjJRRRAB,2,11/29/2022 14:53:25,"Looks like an oversized lodge. Huge rooms but very ordinary. They provide only one pillow per occupant, on request they provide one more additional pillow which two people have to share. They act as if they are doing a favor to you by providing additional pillow.
You get only warm water, not hot.
Food is an other issue, bland South Indian food.
Only silver lining is the service at the Restaurat.
SURELY NOT VALUE FOR MONEY,
An opportunity for an other hotel to come up"

•	House keeping service were very supportive and helpful.
•	Room was neat and the ambience outside is good. Lot of space available for car parking.

3) Hot water is available round the clock.
4) The rooms definitely need pest control (lot of lizards in the room which was irritating).
5) TV cable connection was not good.
6) Attached restaurant is good and the food is priced reasonably."

Good that there was no injury happened . I would like to give a 0 rating but the least rating in the Google is 1. Please do not prefer the place for any event if you are planning to in vaitheeshwaran koil."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNJcWVuSzJBRRAB,3,12/23/2018 07:06:37,"Stayed in Nov 2018 for 2 nights. Rooms were decent. Bathrooms were below average. The green spaces around generate a lot of mosquitoes. Repellents in the rooms are a standard but at times not sufficient. Get your own sprays or whatever as a backup. Food that they served at the restaurant was good but you get the feeling that the restaurant operates with just one cook as the wait times were through the roof! When it got moderately crowded the service went down the tubes as they had very limited staff. Book online as the rates that the Hotel advertises is a total rip-off. We used this hotel as a base for visiting temples in Mayavaram, Srikali, Thiruppungur and Chidambaram. Drive times are reasonable."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzcExhT0xREAE,5,01/22/2020 14:09:57,"Decent rooms. Well maintained property, makes you feel like you’re living in a farmhouse. It’s very close to Vaideeshwaran temple as well. Plenty of shaded parking spots available. The restaurant exceeded our expectations. Food tasted just as good as home and the staff were friendly. Will visit again in the future."

The toilets were very clean and tidy. The restaurant service is good but food not that great which is fine considering other facts of the hotel.

AC restaurant available. Pure Vegetarian."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMydXIta3RBRRAB,4,04/18/2022 20:05:05,Visited only their restaurant a couple of times in the last two months. The waiters are all women and they are very kind and polite. The food is good. They have a lot of space in their area for kids to play and relax.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlNGFiMHNBRRAB,4,10/12/2022 10:10:44,"Room, room service and reception do their job great. In restaurant food is good, but poor in service. They have standard menu, but menu book has enough food, but most of the items not  available."

Decent car parking space. 1 km from temple. Restaurant exits but service is not organised. They ran out of options as early as 9pm and it closed before 10pm.  So a early dinner is preferred here. Room service won't exist after the restaurant closes. It's one of the better places to stay."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQwb3ZQM3l3RRAB,3,10/29/2019 04:04:16,"We stayed in October 2019, and we took a family room.
Pros:
1. Room is quite spacious, neat and bathroom is clean
2. Has quite spacious car parking.
3. Ambience is good, with kids play area.
4. Good view of rice fields and gardens.
5. Staffs are polite and helpful.

Cons:
1. No geyser in all rooms, (only in cottage rooms). They have a common big geyser, which didn't work due to rain.
Don't know which century are they.

Shd provide this very basic facility,
We were waiting upto 7am, after took bath in cold water.
After request, they provided hot water in a bucket for kids,
All this delayed our trip.
2. since it's raining, we took non-AC room,
No NET in windows (since  rice fields, gardens near by, lot of mosquitoes) can't keep the windows open."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNGbjZmUmdnRRAB,,02/24/2019 23:59:59,"It is the best place to stay. The resort was near to nature, with swans walking and  huge trees. It has the best service and very  courteous staff. The restaurant serves very delicious food in banana leaves giving that authentic feel. Overall we thoroughly enjoyed the stay.On the improvement side...the lawns can be maintained better. The reception was available all time at our service. Worth for a in budget and an amazing stay."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNJbHBtZ05BEAE,4,11/13/2018 00:49:39,"Please book online. There is huge difference in price. For instance a double bed room at reception will cost ₹2200 + GST, online the same room costs ₹1250/- all inclusive.

The outside landscape is well maintained.

As there was marriage function, room provided to me was back up room, other than the washroom nothing was maintained. Please be careful with that, if you are going to stay there during some marriage dates / season room service and rooms provided will not be great. They switched me to another room next morning as marriage was over. This room was really good. Well maintained electricals. Room service needs to further improve though.

Wish they maintained all rooms as good as room allotted the next morning. They have maintained the green pastures really well."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXNTZyLXR3RRAB,1,06/28/2022 11:20:12,"Read fully to understand the reason for 1 star.

Response for any additional pillow/etc.: 0/5 (your door might be banged at 4:30 AM intentionally.Reason below).

Room - 4/5 ( -1 for A/C, its not much efficient & swing wasn't working. Please check the A/C before moving the luggage.Rest all good - Bed, restrooms and lights).

Restaurant/service - 5/5 (I really liked the food, even after 9pm they served idly.Most of the items were decent and definitely no complaints).

Room service - 3.5/5 (It may not be prompt but we can adjust since there might be little overcrowd in the Restaurant.Need to mention that quantity of coffee/tea in the flask is way more than you get in any other hotels under room service).

Check-in & check-out : 4/5. (you may need to carry your luggage while check-out).

Incident 1:
We had one baby and 5 year old kid. At reception,around 9:45 PM above,I requested for two pillows and bedsheets.There was a guy with Red-T-shirt said he will bring it.Since one of my kid was asleep, I waited outside of the room to receive the items.There was no movement from the reception and after sometime, one family came for check-in.That Red-T-shirt guy came outside and he was slowly moving the luggage for that family check-in.I waited until he keeps the luggage in their room and comes out.Once he came out, I asked him for pillow/bedsheet - ('with very bad attitude') - he said he can do it only after check-in not before.I told, I will come down now and you can handover the pillow/bedsheet straight away, so that I can go to sleep and I literally came down to ground floor along with him.He said - ('same bad attitude'), there is only one pillow is there, I need to go to the storage room to get another so it will take time so I cant give you.I didn't react and went back to 1st floor and waited.He then settled everyone leisurely and went down and he got the pillows from the same place only.There was a storage box with pillows.So overall he lied and intentionally delayed and made me to wait.Check-in guests need to be given priority and I can wait even longer, even in star hotels, we may have to wait,I agree.But I cant accept his way of speech with attitude which is totally unnecessary and intentionally making the guests to wait is not acceptable.

Incident 2:
My elder son wasn't feeling well, so he slept late and above situation delayed more since my son was waiting for me.My wife and I had half sleep due to baby, that's normal. Around 4:30 or something,we heard a loud bang sound like someone banged the door very hard, except baby all three got up.There was another room opposite to our door and I realized someone is checking in and without doubt,I understood that same Red-T-shirt guy banged the door on purpose.I have no doubt about it.I knew everyone has commonsense and move the luggage slowly at that time.So I don't doubt the guests.The bang sound was pretty hard and clear,it was like - doors has been hit with force. I didn't getup or move, bcz if I getup and start the quarrel , it will disturb all the family members and my son who is not feeling well and it might worsen the situation.Management can verify about the check-in time for the opposite room.

I decided to give 3 stars after incident 1 and after second incident, decided to give 1 star and bring up this concern in the review part rather than discussing this over there. We should be careful enough to handle situation while kids are around.

To the Owners/Senior-management:
There are several people in your Hotel/Stay doing a great job but this person spoils the reputation.Convey our sincere thanks to other staffs.If you ask me,above incident costs '-4' stars, my answer is 'yes', I can wait (or) tolerate the situation but cant tolerate the response with attitude (or) intentional disturbances.Before the above incident ,I already saw him and his actions weren't good.I request you to take action against this person for the above incident.Thanks to you and team."

Overall just ok"

Horrible room service! the restaurant needs to be reminded couple of times (minimum) to bring in the food (even milk/coffee) to your room! Awful! Pathetic! Idk how they got good ratings with this hideous service at the hotel!

Worse.. the reception staff was overly rude and took around 40-50 mins to just provide the hotel room bill and get the payment done..
When questioned about the delay. The Reception staff himself agreed that their Hotel is not as good as other hotels and suggested us to stay somewhere else from our next visit!

Well, who knows better than their own staff!!

Pros.... was their Ducks which kept wandering around in the garden. The garden was pretty.."

They have employed few ladies who tried their level best to serve. Poor to the core Management of a restaurant on 06.11.2021. After 1 hour, they are not able to serve plain dosa also. Chutney is out off stock. Not interested in writing further more bad about the hotel. Management may take serious steps to recruit manpower. Thanks a lot to  the ladies who served us."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURacFl1MHRRRRAB,3,10/05/2023 07:06:22,We went to have dinner. They took more time for taking order. Also many of the items are not available. At that time only dosa is available.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURzdHBMRkV3EAE,4,03/03/2020 14:34:36,A very good hotel in the pilgrim town of Vaitheeswaran Koil with a lot of greenery and walking/playing area for kids.

Since we have 75 meals order. You can have orders, u can give priority to them. It's Ur business. But still you deserve no rights to says food will be served late by 45mins. If you priorities Ur orders, you should have displayed. Hotel closed or orders engaged. You should have inform the customers before they enter, have all old age people in my trip.

Extra bed ordered and reminded 4 times brought very late. No coordination between room service boys & reception Or.Control poor. Nice compound.

The food was good, most of the rooms were comfortable. The bad part was  non- functioning ACs in some of the rooms and people had to be moved out late in the night, one of them had to be given a non-AC room.. poor planning on the management's part to not monitor these before giving a room. If you are planning to come over with a party of 20+, I would think twice and go for a different hotel."

This time we stayed in sadhabishegam. hotel looks clean and neat, small parking space. staff speak the local language and are friendly. restaurant is present and the quality of the food is good.

Rooms are neat and clean, smaller in size though, not a big hifi hotel, it is a modest hotel, but we felt, it is worth the money that you are paying. sorry couldn't take snaps of the room and the restaurant."

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR4OG9PNm1nRRAB,5,06/05/2023 15:57:36,Rooms were clean. The ambiance was good. Staff were customer focused. Food was good.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURGNEt6czJBRRAB,,04/12/2018 23:59:59,"Everything was good. Pleasant stay. Nice location, near to temple. Excellent hotel with children park and lot of birds on garden for a evening walk inside hotel. Food was good. Only thing which was not good was, we booked for 3 adults and they provided a ordinary bed and asked one person to sleep at floor without cot. 24 hours check-in, check-out available."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNleWZyb3JRRRAB,4,09/17/2022 10:59:23,"Nice place as so many people visit Vaitheeswaran temple... spacious and they have cow, duck, turkey and lot space for play area... I have reduced one star for the price as it is too costly compared to other hotel in the same place."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTenUyUHVBRRAB,4,12/26/2020 04:59:05,"Probably the best place to stay near Vaitheeshwaran Kovil. The location is just half KM from temple and bus stand is opposite to hotel and in house restaurant with decent foods are worth to mention. Rooms(Utility AC) were clean and neat. Inside, there is ample amount space for walking and resting. Service is good, no complaints there.

The larger rooms(comfort AC) were bit older, could have been better with maintenance."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNaXJha3FBRRAB,2,12/25/2019 09:02:55,Restaurant staffs running here and there with utensils but nothing was happening. we have wait mearly an hour for any staff to look upon. Very much lacking supervision and staff training. But the served food was tasty. I hope the hotel management would take this issue seriously.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwclpqeDNRRRAB,2,10/06/2019 13:39:28,"Room service needs a lot of improvement. Housekeeping needs undergo a changeover. Ac is not working or the remote is not working. Food quality is below average. Beware you will not get dinner. Only snacks or tiffins in the night.
Ordered for Idli got a lousy sticky ones. With stale chutney."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5MnN5Q01REAE,4,01/27/2021 07:01:25,"The appearance of the hotel is excellent. They have a well maintained compound with several individual rooms. There is a small mandapam for functions and also play area for kids. The hotel has a decent parking space for accommodating the guests. There are 2 restaurants (AC & Non-AC), both serving the same food.

There were totally 5 staff members and they were all very polite and courteous. During peak time, you would feel they are under staffed, since the staff is literally running between tables.

In the room, I noticed spider webs in the corner, which is probably the only reason I am rating at 4 star; otherwise it would have been a 5 star from me.

From now on this would be my preferred stay in Vaitheeswaran Koil visits; requesting you to improve the cleanliness of the room in the above mentioned aspect."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlMXFqZDBRRRAB,2,09/13/2022 10:59:36,The lunch was over all okay. My 4 year plddaughter ate only ghee rice and dne got pretty bad vomit. I am sure something ismixed in ghee or its bad quality.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHa3RqVGpnRRAB,4,10/24/2021 18:52:41,Good choice for a veg hotel in Vaitheeswaran Kovil. AC dining is also available. South Indian and North Indian are available. Service can be improved. Needs some attention to details. Otherwise food is of good quality. Nice place to eat Vegetarian food. 👌🏻
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCaEx2TFdnEAE,1,12/17/2022 09:04:32,"Badly managed restaurant, have no crowd control . It's at the bottom of customer support. You could see our not served leaf in pic ...it took more than hr to finish our lunch, please take a detour if possible"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNjOFp2QkxBEAE,3,03/14/2020 08:37:05,"Nice restaurant. Vegetarian. Good ambience. Friendly staff. Food is good too. Located on the main road, a few minutes from the Temple. Air conditioned. However, food is really expensive. Maybe because the crowd is a floating population. This is the only good restaurant available in the locality."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXcjkyYlVBEAE,5,03/10/2022 10:20:41,"Nice ambiance and good place to stay...

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoNkxxeDFnRRAB,1,02/04/2023 09:07:16,The restaurant inside the hotel is very bad in service. Had to wait for each serving of food. Thought of leaving before they would serve. Rice was not ready and we have keep our plates empty and wait for long time.Not recommended for food.
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2cF9lQzFBRRAB,5,09/14/2021 20:00:19,We didn't eat at the restaurant as it was crowded. However we did spend time chilling outside. It was good to sit at the bench for a while. Place had plenty of car parking and it was clean as well.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5cV9iMlNnEAE,4,02/15/2021 02:54:51,"Restaurant can offer better choices, have more staff.
Appreciate that the bell boy was extremely helpful and courteous. He also very politely turned down the tips offered.
Overall, the staff was very polite, helpful and courteous."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNFbXBMNldnEAE,5,06/16/2019 10:07:06,We stopped over after darshanam at Vaitheeswaran kovil for lunch on our way to chidambaram. Excellent service despite huge rush. Went around the place and able to be with nature. Children play area is perfect with lots of trees and cool breeze on a hot summer afternoon. Love to come back but this time to stay for couple years of days to beat the boredom of city life.
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNbU9xRER3EAE,2,12/15/2019 14:54:48,Poor cleanliness of rooms. TV operates on Tamil channels... No English or Hindi channel. We came from Mumbai and TV facility has no meaning for us. Told to manager but nothing done. They are not paying to cable service provider. No wifi service in room. Very lousy experience
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPbzVHR2tBRRAB,4,06/18/2022 12:29:02,"Wonderful Resort, Have restaurant inside, marriage hall, peaceful environment, maintenance good, you can take photos, employees are good, food quality good, not too much cost...

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1cFkzSlhnEAE,1,08/25/2022 13:34:45,"Basic accommodation, no room service, limited food menu. Staff guided us to a bunch of cheats in the name of Nadi Astro reading - surely due to the kickback they get"
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpdFpXZ1FREAE,4,11/10/2020 11:32:21,"We lunch veg meal Rs.110 not much tasty ,saved hunger but property amenities are good enough. Group friendly property. Best place for dining in vaitheeswaran temple. Short distance from temple."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtd3Vfb1hnEAE,4,12/22/2021 16:06:41,"Location is just a km from the temple of Sri Vytheeswaran. Very neat, clean rooms and walkways and well informed reception guys.
Paisa vasool is the bottom line. Rs. 130/- for a buffet lunch. Overall we liked it."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURGZ09mQUdnEAE,,11/09/2019 23:59:59,The hotel is OK. The rooms are spacious and some what clean also. I was allotted room at 1st floor. But the beds are very harden. Beds could be softer. Rather than that the hotel is very spacious with outside gardens. Over all OK
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNGdjhxaFdnEAE,,09/21/2019 23:59:59,"The accomodation was fine. Although 
1. They could do better with the ACs provided (they were on the verge of getting worn out) and
2.Food.... Overpriced and not to the standard at all. Had to search for some other better ones nearer.. Note: There are plenty of other hotels in the area.
3. Finally, they could do better with the front office service."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1bGE3clhnEAE,3,08/07/2022 16:30:50,"Very expensive for a small Temple town hotel.Decent rooms with lot of open spaces.Three bed cottage cost around 3k plus gst.But the rooms are big to accomodate a large family.
Restaurant items also very expensive."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXci1YY193RRAB,2,03/10/2022 09:47:10,"I was shocked at the way spaces for car drivers are given. They bring people from all over and  in these dtivers' hands are the peoples' lives. How well they're rested depends on how well their sleeping arrangement  is.  My request  is please give decent sleeping arrangement, for the drivers,  who ensure our safety and for whom the hotel should ensure  atleast a simple sleepable bed and a mosquitos  net   to help them rest well."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJbzZESjhRRRAB,4,02/15/2020 15:27:57,Good one.Resort like atmosphere. Lot of open space. Restaurant attached. Rooms are spacious. 1+1 structure.  Recently renovated. Exactly opp. to Vaithesewaran koil Bus terminus. On Mayiladuthurai road.  Temple 10 minutes walk.  Parking available. Possibly the best in that place.

ChRDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHdW9zWBAB,5,11/26/2021 10:33:42,"It is one of the beautiful hotels (situated on the state highway )in Mayiladuthurai district.A haven ,I should say, for people on the move.The hotel is nestled in  an Eden Garden -like ambience.The flora and the fauna(yes,there are a few ducks that  are providing feast to the children's eyes) and the well groomed lawn,the two restaurants- all these will provide more than a pleasant getaway for the family.I enjoyed the filter coffee.Sipping the coffee,I was savouring also the useful information, running on the TV,(in-house close circuit)on some of the tourist attractions, especially on the nearby temples."
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoN192V2J3EAE,5,03/21/2023 08:29:44,"Excellent service by Ms. Parameswari and Mr. Inba.

They have supported my Special child in a matured way.
Thank you once again."
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDc3BTUnRRRRAB,4,09/21/2020 04:58:41,"Good vegetarian restaurant. My review is for lunch. The meals is a must try. Meals are served in plantain leaf. They serve 3 varieties of vegetables, appalam ,payasam,rice , sambar, kozhambu, rasam and buttermilk. The dishes are served hot and everything is tasty. The price is reasonable for the unlimited meals. Service is bit slow and this might be because of the weekend. But all I can say is the food tasted too good. If you are looking for a good place for lunch, then this is the one."

Poori sabzi had hair, and when we addressed this there was no response from them. Also, the sabzi was cold when served . Overall experience was not at all upto the mark."

Food was good but options were limited.  Lot of greenery. Kids will enjoy the geese & hen roaming around freely & also the outdoor play area
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHem9fUnpBRRAB,5,10/29/2021 16:40:40,Very good hotel and resort type stay. Good food and service. We never miss to at least have a coffee here whenever we cross or stop at Vaitheeswarankoil. They have a branch at Thirukadaiyur too..

I paid about Rs 2400/- for a AC double suit just to find the TV under repair, AC remote not working, AC was making a big noise without cooling and absolutely a pathetic situation. There was not a single cup board or even hangers to hang the used clothes. I had to struggle hard to get a reasonably better room after repeatedly going to the booking office for three times to make him understand the real conditions of the room. I felt disgusted. It's just a place hyped so much without any stuff. Despite the cost, there's not even a complementary break fast to the customer. It's just another place where people are exploited, just by using their pilgrimage mindset. We don't concentrate on luxuries and all our thoughts will be on the temple visit and Lord Shiva. These fellows exploit the situation to their gains. I would recommend people to go around to find another hotel or stay at Mayiladuthrai.."

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNRdjZTalBBEAE,1,10/09/2017 04:28:08,"Cockroach in toilet, water leakage, unnecessarily billing for what we did not need (mattress), power trip (electricity) all night, slow service -
limited choice restaurant, dysfunctional AC, noise making fan and staff with horrible attitude. That's what I paid the exorbitant amount of Rs. 2200/room/day for.

Goibibo gives me an invoice which does not contain tax. I paid the tax at the hotel (which is what GI asked me to do), but Hotel does not give me a tax invoice and state that I need to get it from Goibibo. No acknowledgement for the room upgrade charges.
Something fishy is happening here and needs to be investigated by the tax authorities.

Do not believe in the good reviews provided by Goibibo as they are filtering out the not so good ones."
